For the game you need our Android App which you can download under the following link www.gh.com. You need our playground and our markers for the individual characters you will move on the playground. The real characters will appear with help of the camera on your smart phone device.

A physical game board will be placed (our playground) on a table. This board will serve as a AR marker and is captured by the mobile devices from each player. In this way, every player will have access to individual information which could provide an advantage against the other players. Event cards are also shown on the mobile device.

Main Idea:
Our game is called “Ghost HuntAR”. Four players enter a haunted mansion to catch an
evil ghost. The board layout is very similar to “Cluedo”
The evil ghost will appears later during the game process. The game ends if he is
caught. But of course there are smaller ghost haunting the mansion which can be
caught to gather points.
So the winner will be the player that has collected the most points when the evil ghost gets captured!!!

Game process:
Each mobile device is a so-called “Ghost Snapper”. If it is activated and pointed to the board, the positions of nearby small ghosts are shown. But the “Ghost Snapper” consumes battery, so players should only take a quick look to find out ghost locations. At the beginning of each player’s turn the battery of the “Ghost Snapper” will recharge a little bit. A player can use his “Ghost Snapper” anytime he wants during his turn. The “Ghost Snapper” can also display the location of nearby event field where something good or bad can happen. Event field are placed randomly and are invisible in general.The “Ghost Snapper” will only display information about fields in a specific radius around the player’s figurine.
